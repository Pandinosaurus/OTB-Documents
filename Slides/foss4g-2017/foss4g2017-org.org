* Introduction
** Introduction
*** Me
    - My name is Manuel Grizonnet
    - I work at CNES (French Space Agency) 
    - I am involve in the Open Source library for remote sensing image processing Orfeo ToolBox
    - Also a contributor to OSGeo-Live and QGIS
*** Topic
    - Talk about changing the license of a ten years old open source project
    - Why we decide to make this change
    - the strategy that we used to change the license of a 10 years old project
    - Things that we learn
    - More generally how the OTB governance works
    - Recap of the OTB OSGeo incubation process
* Things to know about OTB\ldots
** What is Orfeo ToolBox?
   - *90+ remote sensing applications*
   - Accessible from C++, Bash, GUI, Python, QGIS, Monteverdi, WPS (Zoo)
   - *Monteverdi*, a satellite image viewer (hardware accelerated, raw products)
   - A *C++ library* for image processing, based on ITK
   - *Big Data* (Buzz word detected here!) capable, thanks to built-in streaming, multithreading
    and MPI
   - Apache v2.0 license (since release 6.0) before CeCILL v2 (I'll talk about
     it later\ldots)
   - Funded and developed by CNES (French Space Agency)
   - Used at CNES, ESA, mission exploitation platforms, remote sensing labs, teaching\ldots
   - Built on the shoulders of giants (ITK, GDAL, OSSIM, OpenCV\ldots)
   - *An OSGeo project since July 2017!*

* Moving from CeCILL to Apache
** Before talking about license change
   - Changing the license can be a pain to deal with\ldots
   - But technical details like code review, CLA, Copyright are not the most
     important thing at the end
   - So I talk more about governance, about communication with the community\ldots
   - \ldots and less about technical details of the license change
   - Explain how OTB starts by setting up a more open governance first with a Project
     Steering Committee
   - And how to deal about big changes like this in the most open "way" 

** OTB since the beginning in 2006 
   - Always be a free and open source project
   - Mostly support from the French Space Agency
   - Encourage since the beginning external contributions
   - Code, documentation, mailing list was public since the beginning
   - Try to follow as much as possible open standards
   - People who started the project were great FLOSS advocate
   - \alert{But...}
** OTB decision making process before the PSC
*** the benevolent dictatorship dynasty
*** Who makes feature requests
    - Users from Orfeo CNES program (main funding source for 8 years)
    - CNES team
    - Users from mailing list
*** Who decides
    - CNES team with support of CNES contractors
*** Who actually writes code
    - CNES team
    - CS-SI dev team (funded by CNES)
    - Other contributors
** Why changing?
*** Transparency
    - Users are often informed afterward of major changes
    - No insight on motivations behind some decisions
    - Difficult to participate in decision making
    - OTB is a big project now, someone may want to get involved more deeply
*** For more, easier contributions
    - what was the process for contributing code to OTB?
    - how can I know if my contribution will be accepted?
    - if I contribute a lot, do I get a grip on decision making?
*** For sustainability
    - What if, one day, CNES stops funding OTB at the current level?
    - We need new actors to be able to get involved in OTB!
** OTB project Steering Committee
- In 2015 CNES decided to set-up an open-governance for OTB
- We now have a working PSC, with:
  - Members
  - Rules
  - Decisions
** OTB decision making process
   1. *Request for Comments*
   2. Comments and discussions
   3. Developments
   4. *Requests for changes*
   5. Review
   6. PSC Vote
   7. *Request for Merge*
   8. Approval by Release Manager
   9. Merge
* What has changed since 2015
** ... for users
- Every significant ongoing or passed change is now public and visible
- Users have the opportunity to comment on pending Request for Changes during review
- There are more details available on why and how things were done (and discussions)
- Users can file new Request for Comments to request new features
- Releases are more frequent

** ... for contributors

- There is a clear and detailed process on how to get your code in OTB
- Contributors are guaranteed to be treated with equity
- They know the deadline to get their feature into next release

** Are we making a better OTB?
On the overall, I think that we do.
- We have more code reviews, from external reviewer (even if PSC is still small)
- Changes are more consistent because they belong to the same RFC
- Everyone gets to give his opinion
- New features are more visible

** Moving from CeCILL to Apache
   - The license change consideration starts in the same time as the governance
     set up
   - Also closely related with the OSGeo incubation process
   - PSC, open governance, RFC are strongly based on existing strategies
     implemented in other OSGeo projects like GDAL, GRASS GIS, QGIS\ldots
** Why moving from CeCILL to Apache
   - CeCILL is not a very common license (even if it is compatible with GPL and OSI approved since 2013)
   - Strategy: OTB position in the GIS and image process
   - Strong relationship with ITK (image processing library) distributed under
     the Apache v2 license 
   - In the current context where OTB can be useful, copyleft may also restrict
     the use of the library (for some potential users and contributors)
   - This licensing change also means in our case better management of contributors (CLA and ICLA)
** Personal thoughts
   - Copyleft is a very good protection for open-source software in general
   - I don't like general point of view about open source licenses should be
     used
   - But OTB was considered by many institutions and companies as part of their project
   - From both a strategic and an operational point of view it is a good
     decision for OTB
** Conclusion about license change 1/2
   - Follow guidelines provided by OSI, GNU, Apache foundation\ldots
   - Doing a code review is a long and hard work (especially for a library like
     OTB - more than 500k lines of code)
   - But you always learn things doing a code review
   - It helps a lot for OTB to maintain properly contributions since the
     beginning
   - Helps from a lawyer at CNES (P. Maurette) and S. Dinot from the dev team
   - Changing license follow the same acceptance mechanism as new features (pull request, RFC...)
** Conclusion about license change 2/2
   - For most users changing the license will not change a lot the way that they use OTB
   - Communicate, explain\ldots
   - Always try to find a consensus

* OSGeo incubation
** OSGeo incubation
Once upon a time OTB started the OSGeo incubation
** How does it start?

** How OSGeo helps during the all process?
   - Open governance
     - How to set up the PSC
     - Decision making strategy
     - Documentation license
   - Take time to set up the governance\ldots
   - We wait to complete the license migration before restarting the incubation
     process in 2017
   - It took time\ldots
   - \ldotsBut it was perhaps the time needed by the project 
** Thought about the OSGeo incubation process
* Conclusion
** Conclusion
   - OSGeo incubation starts in 2011 (first application)
   - Being an official OSGeo software will perhaps not change lots of thing...
   - ...but I think that the incubation helps OTB to have a more open process
     and overall
   - Moving to GPL to Apache was also quite a huge work
** Thanks
   - Thanks to the incubation committee and the OSGeo board for the acceptance of OTB
   - This is great news for us!
   - Special thanks to:
     - Our mentor Landon Blake
     - Jody Garnett and Brian M Hamlin who helped in the final stretch
     - Other OSGeo projects related to OTB: GDAL, OSSIM, QGIS, OSGeo-Live, ...
     - Angelos Tzotsos, Even Rouault, Alexander Bruy, Victor Olaya, Paolo Cavallini, Vincent Picavet, Yves Jacolin, Markus Neteler\ldots
     - And many others!
