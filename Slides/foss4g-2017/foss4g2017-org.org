* Me
* Introduction
** Things to know about OTB\ldots
*** Orfeo ToolBox is:
    - An *image processing library* for remote sensing
    - *Free and open source software* under CeCILL-v2 license (equivalent to GPL)
    - *Funded and developed by CNES* (French Space Agency) in the frame of the Orfeo Pléiades program (and beyond)
    - Used at CNES, ESA (European Space Agency), scientific projects, in some
      public administration (mostly French)
** Topic
   The aim of this presentation is:
   - To give an overview of OTB incubation process
   - To describe how Orfeo ToolBox project governance worked (and evolve) since 2010 
   - To explain what the PSC is and how it works
   - To sketch the possibilities offered by this new, more open governance
* Things to know about OTB\ldots
** What is Orfeo ToolBox?
   - *90+ remote sensing applications*
   - Accessible from C++, Bash, GUI, Python, QGIS, Monteverdi, WPS (Zoo)
   - *Monteverdi*, a satellite image viewer (hardware accelerated, raw products)
   - A *C++ library* for image processing, based on ITK
   - *Big Data* (Buzz word detected here!) capable, thanks to built-in streaming, multithreading
    and MPI
   - Apache v2.0 license (since release 6.0) before CeCILL v2 (I'll talk about
     it later\ldots)
   - Funded and developed by CNES (French Space Agency)
   - Used at CNES, ESA, mission exploitation platforms, remote sensing labs, teaching\ldots
   - Built on the shoulders of giants (ITK, GDAL, OSSIM, OpenCV\ldots)
   - *An OSGeo project since July 2017!*

** OTB decision making process before the PSC
*** the benevolent dictatorship dynasty
*** Who makes feature requests
    - Users from Orfeo CNES program (main funding source for 8 years)
    - CNES team (based on feedback from ml and orfeo)
    - Users from mailing list
*** Who decides
    - CNES team with support of CS dev team (contractor)
*** Who actually writes code
    - CS dev team (funded by CNES)
    - CNES team
    - other contributors
** Why changing?
*** Transparency
    - Users are often informed afterward of major changes
    - No insight on motivations behind some decisions
    - Difficult to participate in decision making
    - OTB is a big project now, someone may want to get involved more deeply
*** For more, easier contributions
    - what was the process for contributing code to OTB?
    - how can I know if my contribution will be accepted?
    - if I contribute a lot, do I get a grip on decision making?
*** For sustainability
    - What if, one day, CNES stops funding OTB at the current level?
    - We need new actors to be able to get involved in OTB!
* What has changed?
** ... for users
- Every significant ongoing or passed change is now public and visible
- Users have the opportunity to comment on pending Request for Changes during review
- There are more details available on why and how things were done (and discussions)
- Users can file new Request for Comments to request new features
- Releases are more frequent

** ... for contributors

- There is a clear and detailed process on how to get your code in OTB
- Contributors are guaranteed to be treated with equity
- They know the deadline to get their feature into next release

** ... for developers

- No more silent merging of your 100+ commits branch
- $\Rigtharrow$ Some adjustments needed:
  - Accept comments from review
  - Getting the code merged takes more time
- On the bright side, less surprises on the /develop/ branch
- They know the deadline to get their feature into next release

** Are we making a better OTB?
On the overall, I think that we do.
- We have more code reviews, from external reviewer (even if PSC is still small)
- Changes are more consistent because they belong to the same RFC
- Everyone gets to give his opinion
- New features are more visible

** TODO expliquer la démarche le process le lien avec osgeo
** In case of OTB
*** in the current context where OTB can be useful, copyleft may also restrict the use of the library.
*** This licensing change also means better management of contributors (CLA and ICLA)
*** CeCILL is not a very common license (even if it is compatible with GPL and OSI approved since 2013)

** Thought
*** Copyleft is a very good protection for open-source software in general
*** I don't like the term "business friendly license"
*** But OTB was considered by many institutions and companies as part of their project
** Conclusion about license change
*** Changing license follow the same acceptance mechanism as new features (pull request, RFC...)
*** Follow guidelines provided by OSI, GNU, Apache foundation\ldots
*** It helps a lot for OTB to maintain properly contributions since the beginning 
*** Changing the license was done jointly with a better management of 
** Conclusion bis
*** For most users changing the license will not change a lot the way that thye use OTB
*** Comunicate, explain\ldots

Once upon a time OTB starts the OSGeo incubation

** How OSGeo helps during the all process?

*** expliquer que ça a pris du temps mais le projet a grandi
** Thought about the OSGeo incubation process
* Conclusion
** Ajouter des remercimements ici
** Conclusion
   - OSGeo incubation starts in 2011 (first application)
   - Being an official OSGeo software will perhaps not change lots of thing...
   - ...but I think that the incubation helps OTB to have a more open process
     and overall
   - Moving to GPL to Apache was also quite a huge work
   - Changing license
   - But at the end what counts at last is the community
** Questions ?
