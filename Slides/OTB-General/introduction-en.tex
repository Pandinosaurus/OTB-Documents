\frametitle{Things to know about OTB\ldots}
\begin{block}{Orfeo ToolBox is:}
\begin{itemize}
\item An \textbf{image processing library} for remote sensing
\item \textbf{Free and open source software} under Apache v2.0 license (since 6.0, formerly CeCILL-v2)
\item \textbf{Funded and developed by CNES} (French Space Agency) in the frame
  the development of the Pléiades satellite (and beyond)
\item A project of OSGeo since 2017
\item Used at CNES, ESA (European Space Agency), mission exploitation platforms,
  remote sensing labs, teaching\ldots
\item Written in \textbf{C++} on top of \href{www.itk.org}{ITK} (medical image
  processing)
\item Built on the shoulders of giants (GDAL, OSSIM, OpenCV\ldots)
\item \textbf{Big Data} capable, thanks to built-in streaming and multithreading
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Why open source?}

\begin{block}{Maximum reach}
OTB is dedicated to every user of satellite images. Its wide
dissemination contributes to the missions success (Pléiades, Sentinels\ldots)
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Quality and efficiency}
OTB covers a vast panel of applications and thematic fields. Openness should:
\begin{itemize}
\item Facilitate appropriation and validation for users
\item Encourage contributions and bug reports
\item Available on multiple platforms
\item ``The Cathedral \& the
  Bazaar''\footnote{\url{http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/}}: the more widely available the source code is for public testing
  experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Reproducible research}
OTB capitalizes a part of the CNES R\&D in IP, open source contributes to  transparent, \alert{reproducible} and trans-disciplinary \alert{research}.
\end{block}
