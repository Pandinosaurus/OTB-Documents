* Introduction
** Welcome to OTB Users Days 2017!
*** Thank you all to be here!
    - Thank you for agreeing to spend some time discussing about OTB!
    - Excited to learn about how you use OTB and your feedback
    - Hope that the meeting would be fruitful
*** Getting started
    - OTB Dev team has set up a tentative program
    - But program should be adapted for you
    - Discussions are more important than presentations
    - We can always organize small groups to work on specific topics
    - We need your help to finalize the program

** Recap day 1
*** Day 1
**** Presentations from the OTB development team
     Introduction, What’s new in OTB? open governance, Monteverdi, packaging,
     code provenance review...
**** OTB usage
     - Big Data Solutions for EO(JRC), OTB for BIOMASS, OTB for processing UAS
       imagery (CSIC), Geosigweb
**** Tech talks
     - MPI-powered OTB, new classification framework in OTB, shark in OTB, S1 geometry...
** Recap day 2
*** Tutorials
    - Introduction to Monteverdi 3.0
    - OTB tools for image segmentation
    - Discover the new applications (Classification, Polarimetry)
    - The steganography game
    - Reminder about applications framework and extended filenames
    - Write your own remote module
*** Brainstorming session
    - Should we do SimpleOTB?
    - What is missing in Monteverdi?
    - What is missing in the new classification framework?

    I think that we forgot to provide a report...
** Recap day 3
   - Prototyping SAR visualization in Monteverdi (RFC-39) -> GDAL contribution done!
   - Migrating the Cookbook to RST -> done!
   - Shark integration -> done!
   - In memory application chaining -> done
   - Select image bounds in extended filenames -> done
   - JIRA cleanup -> done :(
   - PSC meeting

** Tentative program 2017
*** https://huit.re/otb_users_days_2017
** Day 1: Talks
   - 15/20 minutes talks and leave 5/10 minutes for questions
   - Language for the event will most probably be French
   - However slides and materials should be in English if possible
   - In parallel: organize Day 2 and 3 (check with session leaders)
** Day 2: Parallel sessions
   - Tutorials
   - Open question & features requests & one-on-one tutoring
   - Brainstorming 
** Day 3: Hackfest
   - Keynote talks: C++11 for OTB?
   - Then 30 minutes planning meeting at the beginning
   - Write the code you need with the help of a member of the
     development team
   - Documentation review: live enhancement of the documentation
   - Live bugfixes: You think you found a bug? We investigate and fix it with you
   - Packaging improvement
   - PSC meeting (to be scheduled)
   - If there is time left: guru code hacking

*Lunch: Pizza party!*
